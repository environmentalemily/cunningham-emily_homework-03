## Problem 1: **Multiple linear regression: model selection and construction**

a\. Creating a table

Table 1: Comparing Models of Predictor Variables For Total Biomass of Native Flowers

| Model Number | Predictors                    | AIC    | Delta AIC |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| Null Model   | none                          | -0.75  | 81.22     |
| Model 1      | SLA, water treatment, species | -153.8 | 2.44      |
| Model 2      | SLA, water treatment          | -95.8  | 60.37     |
| Model 3      | SLA, species                  | -124.1 | 32.12     |
| Model 4      | water treatment, species      | -156.2 | 0.00      |

: Columns of Table 1 are: Model Number, Predictors, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and Delta AIC. Each row represents a different model.

b\. Statistical methods

To examine the influence of water treatment, SLA, and species type on total biomass I created 5 models. The null model depicts a model of total biomass with no predictors. Model 1 is a saturated model that depicts total biomass as a function of SLA, water treatment, and species type. Model 2 depicts total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment. Model 3 depicts total biomass as a function of SLA and species type. Model 4 depicts total biomass as a function of water treatment and species type. To determine the model that best described the accurate predictor(s) of total biomass, I used the model.sel() command from the MuMIn package to create a model selection table, which ranks the models by AIC value. Model 4 had the lowest AIC value, and was therefore ranked first. To evaluate linear model assumptions I, looked at the AIC value, and the diagnostics for the model. Before fitting the model, I looked for a linear relationship between response and predictor variable, confirmed the variables are not influential on each other (independent), and after fitting the model, confirmed points had homoscedasticity (constant variance) of error, and a normally distributed error (which you can see on the qq plot).

## Problem 2: Affective data visualizations

a\. For my data, an affective visualization would look like a collection of points represented by a water droplet shape. They would be organized in order. The left side of the drop will be outlined in a color to represent an activity (scuba, surf, swim, dip), and the right side of the drop will be outlined in a color to represent location (pool, stream, ocean).

d\. Artists Statement

My piece uses water droplets to represent observations (1-39) from my personal data collection, where I recorded the activity I performed in the water each day, even if it was just an ocean dip. Within and around these water drop I show what the specific activity was, what body of water I performed that activity in, and what the high temperature of that day was. After looking through the whole site, I was really inspired by Giorgia Lupi's Week 44 "A Week of Distractions" piece, and actually directly used her outline– tweaking it to fit my variables. I quickly made a wrangled data frame in R with my updated data sheet so that I could easily navigate it, then drew out 39 water droplets on watercolor paper. I created a color key on my brainstorm paper, then filled in the droplets using watercolors appropriately. I added dashed lines to notable good days( i.e. when I got to scuba in the ocean the first time, or hiking to Seven Falls with friends).
